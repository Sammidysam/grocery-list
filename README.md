spellbook
=========

The first project of Xtern Bootcamp practice work.

The issues list contains notes to myself of where to go to further improve the project.

Issues:
- When deleting or adding an element to the list, sometimes extra work is done.
  For example, if deleting from the beginning/end of the list of spells, the entire list is still sorted and readded to the DOM.
  Optimization here would be good.
  To go a step further, when deleting, the list should never be resorted.
  It is all simply a waste of computation.

Next Step:

As this project was in order to familiarize myself with the main concepts of front-end, some areas could be fleshed out more to ensure understanding.
So far, I have read a solid amount about these concepts, but writing some code would probably cement it.

- Flexbox: Create a table?
  How about a sports standings table or something?
- JavaScript inheritance: Write some examples or something, not sure how to best practically use it.
